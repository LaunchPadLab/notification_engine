# Notification Engine
## a Ruby on Rails Gem

# The Problem

- Something happens and peeps need to know 'bout it.
- Some things are important (SMS please!)
- Others are just FYIs (email is fine)
- Peeps have preferences (no SMS please!)
- And peeps speak different languages

So, we need a way to easily create and send notifications to peeps across many different communication mediums, like SMS, Email, Push
